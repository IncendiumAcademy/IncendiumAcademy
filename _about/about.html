    <h2>A Message from the Founders</h2>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, many students can't afford math and science contest tutoring at places like Olympiads, Spirit of Math, etc.
      Without the extra resources, it can be challenging to do well in contests and as a result, can discourage many from pursuing careers in STEM.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why In October, we formed a team of like-minded peers and founded Incendium Academy.
      Our mission is to bridge this gap and balance the playing field of high school math and science contests.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Incendium Academy, we specifically focuses on problem solving techniques used in advanced math,
      physics, and chemistry contests, making it unique from similar platforms.
