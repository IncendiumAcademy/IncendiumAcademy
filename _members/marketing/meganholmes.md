Throughout the past years, I have had the opportunity to explore my interests in STEM subjects in the form of clubs and competitions. I gained experience, skills, and confidence through these activities and I would like to share the opportunity to succeed that I have had with others, whether through my role as a tutor, club leader or through my contributions here with Incendium Academy. I am excited for future opportunities as I enter university next year to study math and computer science.
