Hey! I help create the math videos and lessons here. 
My belief is that math should be entertaining, not boring - a principle I follow when making my lessons.

During quarantine, I spent my time practicing math problems, 
playing chess online, and taking care of my pet ducks. 
When the pandemic ends, I look forward to continuing my passion of competitive fencing.

At uni, I plan to study either computing engineering or computer science.
