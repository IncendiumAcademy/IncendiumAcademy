    <p>We are a non-profit education platform that aims to level the playing
        field for high school students who cannot afford STEM contest preparation.</p>

        <h2>Why we started this</h2>
        <p>5/6 of Canada’s 2019 International Math Olympiad team had out of school training.
            This isn’t an exception, the other STEM contests look like this too.
        </p>
        <p>We believe that one’s ability to pay should not determine success. Everyone should have a fair chance at doing well.</p>
