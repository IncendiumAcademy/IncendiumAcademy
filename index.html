        <h1>A Message from the Founders</h1>
        <p>
            For the past few months, we formed a team of like-minded peers and have been developing an education
            platform to provide free resources for those competing in high school contests. We were inspired to take action
            in our community when we noticed the large disparities between the performances of those who were able to afford
            preparation classes and those who could not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The purpose of our platform is to bridge this gap. Our website is open to anyone seeking to learn, and anyone
            seeking to teach can contribute. It specifically focuses on problem solving techniques used in advanced math,
            physics, and chemistry contests, making it unique from other similar platforms. This project is funded by the #RisingYouth
            grant, a program led by TakingITGlobal, which helps youth in Canada give back to their community.
