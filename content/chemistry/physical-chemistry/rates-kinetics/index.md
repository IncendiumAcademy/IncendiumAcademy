This unit is critical to understanding the mechanisms behind chemical reactions.

Rates and Kinetics are the study of the rates of reactions, and the different factors that affect it. 

If thermodynamics is about the direction of a chemical process, rates and kinetics can be seen as the time it takes to complete.
