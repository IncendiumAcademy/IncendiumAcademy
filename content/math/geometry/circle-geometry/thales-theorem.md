This is a brief extension of the Inscribed Angle theorem, which is useful in questions involving right triangles inscribed within a circle.


Thales Theorem is an extension of the inscribed angle thoerem, and is generally an accepted property of a circle. Things as trivial as Thales are not usually proved during contests - you can get away using it in a contest without doing so.
