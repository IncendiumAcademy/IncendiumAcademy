This is a brief extension of the [Inscribed Angle Theorem](https://incendiumacademy.org/content/math/geometry/circle-geometry/inscribed-central-angles/), 
which is useful in questions involving right triangles inscribed within a circle.


Thales Theorem is generally an accepted property of a circle. Trivial properties like Thales are not usually derived in contests - you can get away using it without doing so.
