    "content": "Reactions are the result of the movement of electrons. In inorganic chemistry, you may have seen this occur during the formation of an ionic compound. For example, in the formation of calcium oxide: . In this case, two electrons are completely transferred from calcium to oxygen (ignore the fact that oxygen wouldn’t occur as a single atom for now). In chemistry, we represent these interactions in more detail using something known as arrow pushing notation. In this case, this electron transfer is represented using a arrow from calcium to oxygen: . The notation is very easy to understand: simply draw an arrow from the electron source to the electron destination. In this case, the electron source is calcium, and the electron destination is oxygen. The arrow-head represents the number of electrons transferred. A double arrowhead represents 2 electrons, and a single arrowhead represents 1 electron. We will also introduce some notation here: nucleophiles are the electron sources, and electrophiles are electron destinations. If you’ve done Lewis acids and bases before, then you’ve also seen these as Lewis bases and Lewis acids, respectively. In organic chemistry, the electronegativity difference between atoms is generally too small for ionic bonding. This means electrons are shared in a bond, rather than given. This gives us 3 main sources (atoms, sigma bonds, pi bonds) and 2 main destinations (atoms, sigma bonds) for electron pairs (we will discuss one electron transfers in a later lesson), which gives us 6 main interactions. We will go through each of these interactions briefly. Atom to Atom . In this interaction, an electron pair is transferred from one atom to another to create a sigma bond between them. There are 2 main ways chemists designate this interaction: . | Draw an arrow directly from the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom . | Draw an arrow from the electron donating atom to the midpoint of the two atoms to emphasize the formation of a bond . | . Both are used in modern chemistry, but for the purposes of this lesson we will be drawing arrows directly between atoms. Atom to Sigma . In this interaction, an electron pair is transferred from the electron donor to the sigma bond between the electron donor and electron acceptor to form a pi bond. Sigma to Atom . In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a sigma bond is transferred to one of the atoms in the bond. We can also transfer the electrons to an atom outside of the bond, in which case it forms a sigma bond between the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom. Sigma to Sigma . In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a sigma bond is transferred to another sigma bond to create a pi bond, breaking the old sigma bond in the process. Pi to Atom . In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a pi bond is transferred to one of the atoms in the bond. We can also transfer the pi electrons to an atom outside of the bond, in which case it forms a sigma bond between the electron donating atom to the electron accepting atom. Pi to Sigma . In this interaction, an electron pair originally used in a pi bond is transferred to a sigma bond to create another pi bond. ",

    "title": "Predicting Electron Movement",
    "content": "Forming Bonds . Imagine a box filled with a high pressure of air, and a box filled with a low pressure of air. When you connect the two boxes, it is obvious that air will move from the high pressure box to the low pressure box. The same principle applies for electrons. In this case, electron “pressure” is more formally known as electron density. Atoms or molecules with high electron density are more likely to donate electrons, making them good nucleophiles or nucleophilic. Similarly, atoms and molecules with low electron density are more likely to accept electrons, making them good electrophiles or electrophilic. 3 main factors affect the electron density of an atom: . Electron Configuration . If an atom has less electrons in its valence energy level than an another atom with the same valence energy level it will have a lower electron density, and vice versa. This is because the radius and therefore “volume” of an atom is based on the valence energy level, and so when that volume does not change, density becomes directly proportional to the number of electrons. For similar reasons, density will generally decrease as the valence energy level goes up, and vice versa. Neighboring Atoms . If an atom is bonded to atoms of higher electronegativity, its electron density will be decreased, and vice versa. This is because shared electrons will be around more electronegative atoms more often. Charge . If an atom has a negative charge, it will have more electrons and therefore have a higher electron density, and vice versa. Using this knowledge, we can predict how some basic interactions will occur. For example, when these two species interact, . We know that the hydroxide oxygen will be the nucleophile. This is because the hydroxide oxygen has a high electron density: it has a negative charge, is on the right side of the periodic table, and has more electropositive atoms bonded to it. We also know that the positively charge carbon will be the electrophile: it has a positive charge, and is more to the left than oxygen is on the periodic table. Therefore, we can predict that electrons will move from the hydroxide oxygen to the positively charged carbon. Breaking Bonds . When breaking bonds, we follow a different set of rules. Instead of utilizing electron density, we utilize electronegativity. In a covalent bond, electrons are shared, but not necessarily equally. Shared electrons will spend the majority of their time in the more electronegative atom. So when a bond breaks, the electrons will tend to prefer moving to the more electronegative atom. We can think about this as a matter of “convenience”; the electrons are already mostly there, so it isn’t that big of a deal to just remain permanently there. We can also think of the more electronegative atom as attracting the electrons more strongly. Utilizing this rule, we can predict the result when a bond breaks. For example, for the following compound: . If we break the covalent bond, the electrons will prefer moving to the chlorine as it is more electronegative. Therefore, the result will be: . ",

A solid understanding of these principles is crucial before progressing into more complicated counting techniques as they are fundamentally inherent in all counting problems. In math problems and even our everyday lives, we often need to enumerate objects and events. For example, we all know how to count the number of students in a class. Or the number of socks in a drawer. However, most counting problems do not involve simply counting a list of items one by one. Thus, we will need better strategies and counting techniques when approaching such problems. ",

    "title": "The Addition Principle",
    "content": "Aristotle or whatever ancient philosopher might’ve argued that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. However, as far as we’re concerned in counting, the whole is equal to the sum of its parts (it might even be less!). The addition principle states that . if there are $k$ events $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_k$ which happen in $n_1,n_2,\\dots,n_k$ ways respectively, and the ways for the events to occur are pairwise disjoint, then the number of ways for a singular outcome to occur is $n_1+n_2+\\dots+n_k$. Or, in a more set theoretic notation, . Let $S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k$ be pairwise disjoint sets, $S_i \\cap S_j = \\emptyset,\\ i \\neq j$. Then, . \\[\\left| \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} S_i \\right| = |S_1 \\cup S_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup S_k| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \\dots + |S_k|\\] Note that there is an emphasis on the events/sets being pairwise disjoint. This means that an outcome for an event is distinct from any other outcome. There should not be any overlaps. Let’s now look at an example problem that uses the addition principle. Example . We want to travel from city $A$ to city $B$. There are $5$ ways to travel by bus, $2$ ways of biking, and $1$ way of walking. How many ways can we travel from $A$ to $B$? . Solution By the addition principle, the total number of ways is $5+2+1=8$. Simple huh? Don't let the simplicity downplay the importance of the addition principle though, you'll be using it a lot in counting problems. However, this is pretty much the full extent of which the addition principle can be used alone. To solve more complicated problems, we will need to combine its use with other counting principles. ",

    "title": "The Multiplication Principle",
    "content": "The multiplication principle will be involved when events don’t happen in just one step. It states that . Assume an event $E$ can be broken down into $k$ ordered events $E_1,E_2,\\dots,E_K$ and that there are $n_1$ ways for $E_1$ to occur, $n_2$ ways for $E_2$ to occur, ., and $n_k$ ways for $E_k$ to occur. Then the number of ways for $E$ to occur is given by $n_1\\times n_2\\times \\ldots \\times n_k$. Or, in a more set theoretic notation, . Let $S_1 \\times S_2 \\times \\dots \\times S_k = \\{(s_1,s_2,\\dots,s_k)\\mid s_i \\in S_i\\}$ denote the cartesian product of the sets $S_1,S_2,\\dots,S_k$. \\[|S_1 \\times S_2 \\times \\dots \\times S_k| = |S_1| \\times |S_2| \\times \\dots \\times |S_k|\\] One thing to take note of is that the multiplication principle is only directly applicable when the events are independent (the outcome of one event won’t affect the outcomes of another event). If the events are not indenendent then we need to take that into consideration when counting our outcomes. Let’s look at some problems involving the multiplication principle. Example 1 . You have $5$ shirts and $4$ pants. How many outfits can you make that consist of one shirt and one pair of pants. Solution We have $5$ choices for the shirt. Then for each shirt we have $4$ choices for the pants. Therefore the total number of outfits we can form is $4\\times 5=20$. Notice that we could've chosen the pants before the shirt and the total would still remain the same. Example 2 . If there are $6$ ways to get from $A$ to $B$ and $9$ ways to get from $B$ to $C$, how many ways are there to get from $A$ to $C$? . Solution This is another straightforward application of the multiplcation principle. The total number of ways to get from $A$ to $C$ will be $6\\times 9=63$. Example 3 . How many divisors are there of $2^{1}\\times 3^{2} \\times 5^{1} \\times 11^{4} \\times 17^{3}$? . Solution This problem requires a little bit of number theoretic insight. A divisor of $2^{1}\\times 3^{2} \\times 5^{1} \\times 11^{4} \\times 17^{3}$ will be of the form $$2^{a}\\times 3^{b} \\times 5^{c} \\times 11^{d} \\times 17^{e} \\text{, where }0\\le a\\le 1, 0\\le b\\le 2, 0\\le c\\le 1, 0\\le d\\le 4, 0\\le e\\le 3$$ There are $2$ choices for $a$, $3$ choices for $b$, $2$ choices for $c$, $5$ choices for $d$, and $4$ choices for $e$. Therefore, the number of divisors is $2\\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 240$. Example 4 . How many four-digit numbers have distinct and nonzero digits? . Solution This is an example of a problem which the events are not independent. If we choose a number for the current digit, we can't choose this number for any later digits. So we can't bindly apply the multiplication principle. However, what we can notice is that although the choices themselves are not independent at each step, the number of choices is. For example, the first digit always has $9$ choices, the numbers from $1$ through $9$. Let's say we choose $1$ as our first digit. Then the choices for the second digit are $2,3,\\dots,9$, $8$ numbers in total. What would happen if we choose $2$ as our first digit? The choices for the second digit are $1,3,4,\\dots,9$, also $8$ numbers in total. We can see that no matter what number we choose for our first digit, there will always be $8$ choices for the second digit. There will be $7$ choices for the third digit and $6$ choices for the the fourth digit. Therefore, the total amount of numbers that satisfy the constraints is $9\\times 8\\times 7\\times 6= 3024$. Example 4 is an example of a problem invoving permutations. This lesson will not be going into detail about them. The general idea of a permutation is to count the number of arrangements of some elements from a set. For Example 4, the problem is to count the number of arrangements of $4$ elements from the set $\\{1,2,\\dots,9\\}$. ",

Euclid 2014 6b . The geometric sequence with $n$ terms $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_{n-1}, t_n$, has $t_1 t_n = 3$. Also, the product of all $n$ terms equals $59049$. Determine the values of $n$. Solution Here's a scenario where I'd say brute forcing actually works. Evaluating: $$ \\begin{align*} t_1 \\cdot t_2 \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot t_{n-1} \\cdot t_n &amp;=59049\\\\ a \\cdot ar \\cdot \\ldots ar^{n-2} \\cdot ar^{n-1} &amp;= 59049\\\\ (a)^n \\cdot (r \\cdot r^2 \\ldots r^{n-1}) &amp;= 59049\\\\ a^n \\cdot r^{\\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)} &amp;= 59049 \\; \\; (1) \\end{align*} $$ . Now let's look at what else we were given. From $t_1 t_n = 3$, $$ \\begin{align*} (a)(ar^{n-1}) &amp;=3\\\\ a^2 r^{n-1} &amp;=3 \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; \\; (2) \\end{align*} $$ . Note that $(1)$ and $(2)$ are close to each other. We can raise $(2)$ to the $n$th power, getting; $$ \\begin{align*} (a^2 r^{n-1})^n &amp;= 3^n\\\\ a^{2n} r^{n(n-1)} &amp;= 3^n \\end{align*} $$ We can further raise both sides to the $\\frac{1}{2}$ power, getting; $$ \\begin{align*} (a^{2n} r^{n(n-1)})^{\\frac{1}{2}} &amp;= (3^n)^\\frac{1}{2}\\\\\\\\ (a^n r^{\\frac{1}{2}(n)(n-1)}) &amp;= 3^{\\frac{n}{2}} \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\; (3) \\end{align*} $$ Since $(3) = (1)$, we can conclude $3^\\frac{n}{2} = 59049 = 3^{10}$ $$ \\therefore n = 2 \\cdot 10 = 20. $$ QED . Euclid 2010 5b . A geometric sequence has 20 terms. The sum of its first two terms is 40. The sum of its first three terms is 76. The sum of its first four terms is 130. Determine how many of the terms in the sequence are integers. Solution You can find out what the third and fourth terms are, by taking the difference between the first two and first three terms; and the first three and first four terms respectively. $\\therefore$ the third term is $76-40=36$ and the fourth term is $130-76=54$. We can then find the common ratio, by dividing these numbers. $$\\therefore r=\\frac{54}{36}=\\frac{3}{2}$$ . Next, we want to find the first term of the sequence, so that we can derive the general term. To do this, we simply divide by $\\frac{3}{2}$ from the third term twice. $$ \\begin{align*} t_1 &amp;= 36 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3}\\\\ \\therefore t_1 &amp;= 16. \\end{align*} $$ $$ \\therefore t_n = 2^4 (\\frac{3}{2})^{(n-1)}. $$ . Recall that the question asked for the number of integers in the sequence. By observing the general term, we can see that values of $n&gt;5$ will yield a fractional term. Therefore, there will be 5 integers in this sequence. Harder Problems . Harder problems often incorporate other math topics, like logarithms, systems of equations, etc. Euclid 2009 9a . If $\\log_2 x, (1 + \\log_4 x)$, and $\\log_8 4x$ are consecutive terms of a geometric sequence, determine the possible values of $x$. Solution It's best practice to simplify the logarithms to the same base. Let's set all the bases to 2. For the second term: $$1+\\log_4x = 1 + \\frac{\\log_2 x}{\\log_2 4} = 1 + \\frac{\\log_2 x}{2} = 1+\\frac{1}{2}\\log_2x$$ For the third term: $$\\log_8 4x=\\frac{\\log_2 4x}{\\log_2 8} = \\frac{\\log_2 4 + \\log_2 x}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{\\log_2 x}{3}$$ . To keep things cleaner in our solution, let's substitute $\\log_2 x = y$. Since the three terms are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence, we can then use our geometric mean. $$ \\begin{align*} \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{y}{3}}{1 + \\frac{y}{2}} &amp;= \\frac{1 + \\frac{y}{2}}{y}\\\\ y\\left(\\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{y}{3}\\right) &amp;= \\left(1+\\frac{y}{2}\\right)^2\\\\ \\frac{2}{3}y + \\frac{y^2}{3} &amp;= 1 + y + \\frac{1}{4}y^2\\\\ 8y + 4y^2 &amp;= 12 + 12y + 3y^2\\\\ y^2 - 4y - 12 &amp;=0\\\\ (y-6)(y+2)&amp;=0 \\end{align*} $$ . From this quadratic, we see that $y= \\log_2 x = 6$ or $-2$. $\\therefore x = 2^6 = 64$ or $x= 2^{-2}= \\frac{1}{4}$ . QED 2004 AMC 10A P18 . 2010 AMC 10B P16 .

    "content": "Elementary Reactions . If a reaction occurs in a single collision, we call it an elementary reaction. In organic chemistry, we may also describe these reactions as concerted. We can describe the rate law easily for these reactions. For a general elementary reaction, described as: . \\[\\ce{aA + bB ... -&gt; cC + dD ...}\\] the rate law can be described as: . \\[Rate = k[\\ce{A}]^a[\\ce{B}]^b...\\] We can prove this intuitively or with math. Intuitively . The number of collisions is directly proportional to the rate. To find out the rate law, let us first think about a reaction which is caused by the collision by a molecule of A and a molecule of B. \\[\\ce{A + B -&gt; C}\\] Intuitively, the number of collisions should be directly proportional to the number of molecules of A and B in a given space. This means the rate law will be \\(Rate = k[A][B]\\). Now let us think of a reaction which is caused by the collision of two molecules of A. \\[\\ce{2A -&gt; C}\\] We can imagine splitting the A molecules into two distinct groups which collide with each other: . \\[\\ce{A_1 + A_2 -&gt; C}\\] This is essentially the first case: two distinct molecules are colliding with each other, so the rate will be proportional to both their concentrations. This leads us to the rate law: . \\[Rate = k[\\ce{A_1}][\\ce{A_2}]\\] However, since the A molecules aren’t actually distinct, the rate law simplifies to: . \\[Rate = k[\\ce{A}]^2\\] In the general case, we get the desired formula of \\(Rate = k[\\ce{A}]^a[\\ce{B}]^b...\\) . Math . Some prerequisite math knowledge is needed to understand this: [Link to combinatorics lesson here] . First, we set an arbitrary volume for our reaction vessel. In our case, we will use \\(1\\ \\text{L}\\). This is just to make calculations easier. We will calculate the number of total possible collisions, as it will be proportional to the number of collisions per second and therefore the rate. We can think about this as a combinatorics problem; a collision is just choosing molecules from each reactant. For our first basic case, let’s use this reaction: . \\[\\ce{A + B -&gt; C}\\] Let’s first imagine the reaction vessel had one A molecule and one B molecule. We can select one A molecule in \\(\\binom{1}{1} = 1\\) way and one B in molecule in \\(\\binom{1}{1} = 1\\) way. Therefore, the total number of possible collisions is \\(1 * 1 = 1\\). Now, let’s generalize to a case with \\(x\\) A molecules and \\(y\\) B molecules. We can select one A molecule in \\(\\binom{x}{1} = x\\) ways and one B molecule in \\(\\binom{y}{1} = y\\) ways. Therefore, the total number of possible collisions is \\(x*y\\). Since concentration is amount of substance in a certain amount of volume, and rate is proportional to the total number of possible collisions, we end up with \\(Rate = k[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B}]\\). For our next case, let’s use this reaction: . \\[\\ce{2A + 3B -&gt; C}\\] Let’s imagine the reaction vessel had \\(x\\) molecules of A and \\(y\\) molecules of B. We select two molecules of A in \\(\\binom{x}{2}\\) ways and 3 molecules of B in \\(\\binom{y}{3}\\) ways. As \\(x\\) increases, \\(\\binom{x}{2}\\) becomes more and more proportional to \\(x^2\\). This is because \\(\\binom{x}{2} = \\frac{(x)(x-1)}{2} \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2}\\) . Similarly, as \\(y\\) increases, \\(\\binom{y}{3}\\) becomes more and more proportional to \\(y^3\\). Since the number of molecules in a real reaction will likely be very large, we know that the total number of possible collisions is proportional to \\(x^2 * y^3\\). Therefore, we end up with the rate law: \\(Rate = k[\\ce{A}]^2[\\ce{B}]^3\\). In general, \\(\\binom{x}{n}\\) will become more proportional to \\(x^n\\), leading to the general rate law. Non-elementary Reactions . In the real world, many complex reactions do not occur in just one collision. They often through a series of elementary reactions known as a mechanism. In this case, the rate law can not be described with the general formula. Rate-determining Step . In every mechanism, there will be a step that is the slowest. If this step is significantly slower than the other steps, then we call it the rate-determining step. This means that the rate of the reaction is described by the rate law of this step. We can think about this intuitively. If we think about the reaction as a relay race, where the product of each step is passed as the reactant of the next, it becomes obvious. If Usain Bolt is in a relay race team with a tortoise, it doesn’t matter how fast Usain Bolt runs his section. The majority of each relay lap will be spent during the tortoise’s section, and so the tortoise’s speed will essentially be the speed of the team. Therefore, if we are given the mechanism of a reaction and its slowest step, we can generally find a rate law for the whole reaction. For example, let’s use this hypothetical reaction: . \\[\\ce{A2 + 2B2 -&gt; A2B4}\\] Say that a mechanism has been determined by a chemist: . \\[\\begin{align} \\ce{A2 &amp;-&gt; 2A} &amp;(slow)\\\\ \\ce{A + B2 &amp;-&gt; AB2} \\\\ \\ce{AB2 + B2 + A&amp;-&gt; A2B4} \\end{align}\\] Given that the first step is significantly slower than the rest, we know that the rate law of the entire reaction can be determined by the rate law of the first step. Using our knowledge on the rate law of elementary reactions, we determine that the rate law of the first step and therefore the entire reaction is: . \\[Rate = k_1[\\ce{A2}]\\] However, it is not always this easy to determine the rate law. If the slowest step were instead the second step for example: . \\[\\begin{align} \\ce{A2 &amp;-&gt; 2A}\\\\ \\ce{A + B2 &amp;-&gt; AB2} &amp;(slow)\\\\ \\ce{AB2 + B2 + A&amp;-&gt; A2B4} \\end{align}\\] we would run into an issue. The rate law of the second step is: . \\[Rate = k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}]\\] But this rate law can not be simply used as the rate law for the entire reaction. This is because it contains the concentration of what is known as an intermediate, or something that only appears in the middle of a reaction, as it is produced in a step, and then used in a later step. From its definition, the rate law must describe the rate in terms of the concentrations of the reactants, so this can not be simply used. Pre-equilibrium Approximation . Let’s say the chemist revises his mechanism so that the first step is now reversible: . \\[\\begin{align} \\ce{A2 &amp;&lt;-&gt; 2A}\\\\ \\ce{A + B2 &amp;-&gt; AB2} &amp;(slow)\\\\ \\ce{AB2 + B2 + A&amp;-&gt; A2B4} \\end{align}\\] Recall that all this means is that both the forward and backward reaction can occur. We could also write this as: . \\[\\begin{align} \\ce{A2 &amp;-&gt; 2A}\\\\ \\ce{2A &amp;-&gt; A2} \\\\ \\ce{A + B2 &amp;-&gt; AB2} &amp;(slow)\\\\ \\ce{AB2 + B2 + A &amp;-&gt; A2B2} \\end{align}\\] On their own, reversible reactions tend to reach equilibrium. As a refresher, equilibrium is the state at which the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. Using the rate laws of the forward and backward reaction, we can express what equilibrium of our reversible step would look like: . \\[\\begin{align} Rate_{forward} = k_1[\\ce{A2}] \\\\ Rate_{backward} = k_{-1}[\\ce{A}]^2 \\\\ k_1[\\ce{A2}] = k_{-1}[\\ce{A}]^2 \\\\ [A] = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1[\\ce{A2}]}{k_{-1}}} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] Therefore, if the first step was at equilibrium, we would be able to write the concentration of the intermediate in terms of the concentration of the reactants, solving our earlier issue. Luckily for us, we can actually assume the first step is at equilibrium due to the pre-equilibrium approximation. This approximation says that if a slow step uses a product or reactant in a fast reversible reaction, we can assume that the reversible reaction is still in equilibrium. We can think about this using an intuitive example. Imagine there are two tanks of water divided by a plate that has many holes: . This simulates our fast equilibrium reaction. The water goes from the left side to the right side at a rate equal to the rate water goes from the right side to the left side, meaning it is at equilibrium. Now let’s poke a small hole in the right side. This will simulate the slow step following the reversible reaction. We see that the water levels of the two sides remain equal, as the rate at which the water leaves the right side is slow enough that equilibrium can still roughly be reached. Back to our example, we can therefore plug in our expression for \\([A]\\) into the rate law of the second step: . \\[\\begin{align} Rate &amp;= k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] \\\\ [A] &amp;= \\sqrt{\\frac{k_1[\\ce{A2}]}{k_{-1}}} \\\\ Rate &amp;= k_2\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1[\\ce{A2}]}{k_{-1}}}[\\ce{B2}] \\\\ &amp;= k_2\\sqrt{\\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}} [\\ce{A_2}]^{1/2}[\\ce{B2}] \\\\ &amp;= k[\\ce{A2}]^{1/2}[\\ce{B2}] \\end{align}\\] We now have the rate law of our reaction. Steady-state Approximation . Let’s say the chemist revises his mechanism again so that the third step is now the slowest: . \\[\\begin{align} \\ce{A2 &amp;&lt;-&gt; 2A}\\\\ \\ce{A + B2 &amp;-&gt; AB2}\\\\ \\ce{AB2 + B2 + A&amp;-&gt; A2B4} &amp;(slow) \\end{align}\\] Let’s write out the rate law of the rate-determining third step: . \\[Rate = k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}]\\] We once again run into the problem that there are intermediates in the rate expression. In this case, we can no longer use the pre-equilibrium approximation. Instead, we use the steady state approximation. This approximation assumes that the intermediates in a reaction shouldn’t build up, since intermediates are generally unstable and be in the final product. Because of this, the rate that they are produced should equal the rate that they are consumed. Let’s first do this for the intermediate \\(\\ce{AB2}\\). The second step is the only step where \\(\\ce{AB2}\\) is produced, or in other words, in the products. Therefore, the rate of production of \\(\\ce{AB2}\\) is equal to the rate of reaction of the second step: . \\[Rate_{produced} = k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}]\\] The third step is the only step where \\(\\ce{AB2}\\) is consumed, or in other words, in the reactants. Therefore, the rate of consumption of \\(\\ce{AB2}\\) is equal to the rate of reaction of the third step: . \\[Rate_{consumed} = k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}]\\] Since the rate at which it is consumed should equal the rate at which it is produced, we get the following relation: . \\[\\begin{align*} Rate_{produced} &amp;= Rate_{consumed} \\\\ k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] &amp;= k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}] \\end{align*}\\] This relation can be simplified to get an expression for \\([\\ce{AB2}]\\). \\[[\\ce{AB2}] = \\frac{k_2}{k_3}\\] Now let’s look at the intermediate \\(\\ce{A}\\). \\(\\ce{A}\\) is only produced in the forward reaction of the first step. \\[Rate_{produced} = k_1[\\ce{A2}]\\] \\(\\ce{A}\\) is consumed in the reverse reaction of the first step, in the second step and in the third step. \\[Rate_{consumed} = k_{-1}[\\ce{A}]^2 + k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] + k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}]\\] Once again, since the rate at which it is consumed should equal the rate at which it is produced, we get the following relation: . \\[\\begin{align*} Rate_{produced} &amp;= Rate_{consumed} \\\\ k_1[\\ce{A2}] &amp;= k_{-1} [\\ce{A}]^2 + k_2[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] + k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}] \\end{align*}\\] Let’s substitute our \\([\\ce{AB2}]\\) term that we found earlier and simplify: . \\[\\begin{align*} k_1[\\ce{A2}] &amp;= k_{-1} [\\ce{A}]^2 + k_{ 2 }[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] + k_3\\frac{k_2}{k_3}[\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}] \\\\ k_1[\\ce{A2}] &amp;= k_{-1}[\\ce{A}]^2 + 2k_{ 2 }[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] \\\\ \\end{align*}\\] \\[\\therefore k_{-1}[\\ce{A}]^2 + 2k_{ 2 }[\\ce{A}][\\ce{B2}] - k_1[\\ce{A2}] = 0\\] We can now solve for \\([\\ce{A}]\\) using the quadratic formula. A lesson on how to solve quadratics is linked here: [Insert link to math lesson on quadratics here] . \\[[\\ce{A}] = \\frac{-2k_2 + \\sqrt{(2k_2)^2 + 4k_{-1}k_1[\\ce{A2}]}}{2k_{-1}} = \\frac{-k_2 + \\sqrt{{k_2}^2 + k_{-1}k_1[\\ce{A2}]}}{k_{-1}}\\] We will now plug these terms into the rate law of the rate-determining third step: . \\[\\begin{align*} Rate &amp;= k_3[\\ce{AB2}][\\ce{B2}][\\ce{A}] \\\\ Rate &amp;= k_3\\frac{k_2}{k_3}[\\ce{B2}]\\frac{-k_2 + \\sqrt{{k_2}^2 + k_{-1}k_1[\\ce{A2}]}}{k_{-1}} \\\\ Rate &amp;= k_2[\\ce{B2}]\\frac{-k_2 + \\sqrt{{k_2}^2 + k_{-1}k_1[\\ce{A2}]}}{k_{-1}} \\end{align*}\\] Now we have the rate law of our reaction! .
